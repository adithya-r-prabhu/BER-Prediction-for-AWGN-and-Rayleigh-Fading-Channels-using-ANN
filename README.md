## Overview

In wireless communications, accurately predicting the Bit Error Rate (BER) is crucial for system design and optimization. Traditional methods rely on complex mathematical formulas that can be computationally expensive. This project demonstrates how Artificial Neural Networks can be trained to predict BER efficiently across different:

- **Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR)**: 0 to 20 dB
- **Modulation Schemes**: BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM
- **Channel Types**: AWGN and Rayleigh Fading

## Features

- **MATLAB Dataset Generation**: Comprehensive simulation code for generating BER data with adaptive bit counting for accurate high-SNR measurements
- **Jupyter Notebook Analysis**: Complete Python implementation for data preprocessing, ANN training, and visualization
- **Multiple Modulation Schemes**: Support for BPSK, QPSK, and 16-QAM
- **Dual Channel Models**: Both AWGN and Rayleigh fading channel simulations
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves R² > 0.99 on BER prediction
- **Comprehensive Visualization**: Training curves, prediction vs. actual plots, and BER vs. SNR curves

## Methodology

### Channel Models

#### AWGN Channel
The Additive White Gaussian Noise channel is the simplest model where the transmitted signal is corrupted only by white Gaussian noise:

```
y = x + n
```
where `n` is the Gaussian noise with zero mean.

#### Rayleigh Fading Channel
Models multipath propagation in environments without a direct line-of-sight path:

```
y = h·x + n
```
where `h` is the complex Rayleigh fading coefficient.

### Modulation Schemes

| Scheme | Bits/Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| BPSK   | 1           | Binary Phase Shift Keying |
| QPSK   | 2           | Quadrature Phase Shift Keying |
| 16-QAM | 4           | 16-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation |

### Adaptive Simulation Strategy

The MATLAB code implements an adaptive simulation approach:
- **High BER region (>10⁻³)**: Standard Monte Carlo simulation
- **Medium BER region (10⁻⁵ to 10⁻³)**: Extended bit counts for accuracy
- **Low BER region (<10⁻⁷)**: Theoretical estimation to avoid excessive computation

## Dataset

The dataset (`ber_dataset_improved.csv`) contains 1,230 samples with the following features:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `SNR_dB` | Signal-to-Noise Ratio in decibels (0-20 dB) |
| `Mod_Code` | Modulation type code (1=BPSK, 2=QPSK, 3=16QAM) |
| `Ch_Code` | Channel type code (1=AWGN, 2=Rayleigh) |
| `BER` | Bit Error Rate (target variable) |
| `Modulation` | Modulation type label |
| `Channel` | Channel type label |

## Results

### Model Performance

| Channel | R² Score | MSE (on BER) | MAE (on BER) |
|---------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| AWGN    | ~0.97    | ~0.06        | ~0.16        |
| Rayleigh| ~0.999   | ~4.23e-06    | ~1.13e-03    |

### Key Findings

- The ANN successfully learns the relationship between SNR, modulation scheme, and BER
- Rayleigh channel predictions show higher accuracy due to more consistent BER patterns
- The log transformation of BER significantly improves training stability
- Early stopping prevents overfitting while achieving optimal performance
